# Python Simple Example

Minimal Agent Gauntlet example using plain Python, the starter kit clients, and the OpenAI-compatible proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 recommended (submissions run on 3.12); 3.11–3.13 work (`>=3.11,<3.14`)
- Base setup from the repository root:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - `cp .env.example .env` and configure values

## Install Dependencies

From this directory (`examples/python_simple`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This example adds:

- `mcp`
- `openai`

## Run

From this directory (`examples/python_simple`):

```bash
python agent.py
```

The script loads `.env` from the repository root automatically.

## What You See

- A short summary of the challenge: the question or image task, the answer
  format, the clue count, and the tools you must call.
- One live line while the model thinks (elapsed time, rough tokens, latest
  phrase), then a summary: time, tokens, why it stopped, and the answer. Set
  `SHOW_REASONING=off` to hide the live line.
- The result (`Accepted`, `Status`, `Score`, and any missing required tools).
- `outputs/<agent_id>-run.json`: the full challenge (every clue), model,
  answer, tokens, time, and score, so you can compare runs. Image runs also
  save the submitted image as `outputs/<agent_id>-submission.<ext>`. `outputs/` is ignored by git and never
  packaged.

## How It Works

This example is the fastest way to understand the full Agent Gauntlet lifecycle with minimal abstraction. The agent loads your environment, registers with the Agent Gauntlet Platform API, discovers MCP tools at runtime, and solves challenges via the LLM proxy.

The solving loop is intentionally simple so you can see all moving parts clearly: challenge retrieval, prompt building, model selection, answer extraction, and submission.

## Key Files

- `agent.py`: minimal end-to-end implementation
- `requirements.txt`: framework-specific dependencies for this example

## Customization

- Edit [`../../my_strategy.py`](../../my_strategy.py) to set:
  - `agent_name` (and `agent_id`, used only when `AGENT_ID` in `.env` is empty)
  - prompts (`text_system_prompt`, strategy notes)
  - model ranking and generation settings (`rank_models()`, `pick_model()`, temperature, max tokens)
- Start here before moving to framework-based examples.

## When to Use This Example

- First run in a fresh environment
- Debugging connectivity and auth issues
- Building your own custom agent without framework lock-in
